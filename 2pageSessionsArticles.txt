Despite the boom seen in the fastfood business industry, Sbarro counts itself as one of the few who were unable to capitalize on the growth trend. According to a Forbes newsmagazine report, the fastfood restaurant chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in less than three years the company had filed for the first time. The company also showed trouble brewing this year when it announced on February that it will be shuttering 155 of its 400 restaurants across North America. Forbes said that the bankruptcy news will not affect the the 600 stores owned by franchisees.Restaurant consultant and president Michael Whiteman of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York said that the latest development at the pizza chain was inevitable. He told Reuters, "Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model. Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order. I don't know that it has a sustainable business over the longer term. The way to turn the company around in the short haul is to get out of money-losing leases and close stores, which it has been doing."Founded by Italian immigrants Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro in 1956, Forbes said the company grew to a 799-store firm across 40 countries and employs over 2,700 people. Majority of its stores in the US are located in malls, where it has been observed that foot traffic and food court spending has slowed down.AdvertisementIn its court filing, Sbarro reported $175.4 million in assets and $165.2 million in liabilities, Reuters said. The pizza chain plans to shed $140 million of secured debt in the reorganization, and has tapped advisers, which include Moelis & Co, Loughlin Management and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis to help them with the process.AdvertisementChief Executive David Karam had said about the bankruptcy filing, "The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step."The news agency said that Sbarro filed for bankruptcy protection in April less than three years ago and emerged the following November.Like Us on FacebookAdvertisement

We told you last week that mediocre pizza-slinger and mall mainstay Sbarro would likely be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Today, it made that filing official, making this the second bankruptcy for Sbarro since the spring of 2011.The pizza chain has some $140 million in debt to lenders. According to the Wall Street Journal, the bankruptcy plan would hand over control of the company to the creditors in exchange for wiping away that red ink. The lenders involved in the deal will also provide a $20 million bankruptcy loan to aid in restructuring the chain that has faltered in the face of increased competition and decreased foot traffic to the malls that have called Sbarro home for decades.Sbarro will also be put on the auction block to see if anyone is willing to buy the beleaguered restaurant chain.The bankruptcy comes on the heels of a recent announcement to shutter 155 of the remaining 400 Sbarro locations in North America. There are another 600 Sbarro locations outside of North America that are unaffected by this filing.The company filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was able to substantially reduce its debt from $400 million to its current level.

The national pizza chain Sbarro -- which has locations in shopping malls and outlet centers in Birmingham, Huntsville and Florence -- has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years, Reuters news service reported earlier today.Sbarro is struggling with too much debt and with fewer customers in the malls that house many of its restaurants, according to the Reuters report.Under a "pre-packaged" Chapter 11 reorganization, the Melville, N.Y.-based company should make a "quick exit" from bankruptcy before May 7, the company said today, according to Reuters.Founded in 1956, Sbarro has tried to increase sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor other fast-casual restaurant chains, Reuters reported.An "unprecedented decline in mall traffic" and an "unsustainable" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, Sbarro chief financial officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing.Sbarro has locations at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, at the Outlet Shops of Grand River in Leeds, at Parkway Place in Huntsville and at Regency Square Mall in Florence, according to the company's website.It is not yet known how Sbarro's bankruptcy will affect those locations, but according to Reuters, the company said it recently closed more than 180 restaurants, and expects to close about 50 more. The bankruptcy will not affect 582 locations that are owned by franchisees.To read the full Reuters report, click here.UPDATED at 3:17 CDT on Monday, March 10, 2014 to correct that Sbarro does not have a location in Mobile and to add that Regency Square Mall is in Florence.
We told you last week that mediocre pizza-slinger and mall mainstay Sbarro would likely be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Today, it made that filing official, making this the second bankruptcy for Sbarro since the spring of 2011.The pizza chain has some $140 million in debt to lenders. According to the Wall Street Journal, the bankruptcy plan would hand over control of the company to the creditors in exchange for wiping away that red ink. The lenders involved in the deal will also provide a $20 million bankruptcy loan to aid in restructuring the chain that has faltered in the face of increased competition and decreased foot traffic to the malls that have called Sbarro home for decades.Sbarro will also be put on the auction block to see if anyone is willing to buy the beleaguered restaurant chain.The bankruptcy comes on the heels of a recent announcement to shutter 155 of the remaining 400 Sbarro locations in North America. There are another 600 Sbarro locations outside of North America that are unaffected by this filing.The company filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was able to substantially reduce its debt from $400 million to its current level.

Shocking no one, Russia's top natural gas producer, Gazprom, announced last Tuesday that it will cancel a discount on the price it charges for gas in Ukraine.The bargain, a sweet 30% off the price of gas, was a bid by Moscow to deter Ukraine from accepting a trade deal with the EU."This is not linked to politics or anything," Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Tuesday, regarding the discount cancellation.The ongoing Ukraine crisis is often cast as a battle of values, East versus West. But another way of looking at things is to follow the old gas lines.In a nutshell:Ukraine would freeze without Russia.Some 60% of Ukraine's consumed gas comes from Russia. Over the years this reliance has given rise to a so-called gas "mafia" in Kyiv. Ukrainian oligarchs, working closely with Russian suppliers, have taken advantage of the dependency. It is widely believe that these elites siphon money from state coffers and actively prevent Ukraine from developing a sustainable energy sector. All the while, foreign investors are scared away.Similarly, Russian energy supplies help Moscow to keep a firm grip on other former Soviet states like Moldova and Georgia. In September Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin threatened to cut off Moldova's gas supply during the winter if the country continued on its pro-EU economic course. "We hope," said Rogozin to Moldavians, "that you will not freeze."Europe is hooked too.Russia supplies, but Ukraine is the middleman. This helps to explain why some European states (like Germany) have been cagey about imposing sanctions on Russia. Germany and Ukraine are Gazprom's biggest foreign purchasers.Russia is Europe's largest natural gas supplier, supplying about one-third of the continent's natural gas, more than half of which travels through Ukraine. Important pipelines pass through Ukraine to Slovakia, and then on to Germany, Italy and Austria.So, what would happen if Russia switched off the Ukrainian pipes? Actually it has done just that twice over the last decade, in 2006 and again in 2009, amid pricing disputes between Kyiv and Moscow. The result: gas shortages in several European countries.Already Europe is working to wean itself off Russian supplies. Ukraine's woes might help to speed up that process.It's a two-way street.Russia needs Europe too. Oil and gas trade accounts for half of Russia's annual export revenue and more than half of Russia's federal budget.Important to note is that many of Russia's important gas pipelines go through Western Ukraine, which is decidedly pro-Europe."I would argue that Russia has more to lose than Europe at the moment," says Tim Boersma of the Brookings Institution. "Russia needs European demands. It is making roughly $100 million a day from hydrocarbons.What about America?Washington is making moves. The U.S. doesn't export natural gas yet. But congressional Republicans especially are calling to loosen U.S. export restrictions, with the idea that if Washington puts more gas on the market, it can (economically) cut Russia down to size.The U.S. Department of Energy is issuing permits to American corporations that will let them start exporting gas in 2015.Fun fact: Who is now leading the U.S. State Department's new Bureau of Energy Resources? It's Carlos Pascual, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.So what about that new global order?In recent weeks Eurasia experts and political hacks have been talking big about a new global energy order inspired by events in Ukraine.Chaos in Ukraine, goes this logic, will threaten natural gas supplies and push Europe to look for non-Russian gas sources.It's already happening. U.S. energy behemoth Halliburton Co. will soon start fracking in Poland. Royal Dutch Shell will start hunting for natural gas in Ukraine next year.In fact, Europe is already way less energy-dependent on Russia than it was in 2009, the last time Moscow switched off the Ukrainian pipelines. Germany, for instance, has found alternative energy sources in Norway and Algeria.2009 was a turning point. And 2014 could be Russia's biggest mistake yet.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2015 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month.

Aust dollar weaker in early tradeThe Australian dollar has lost ground as tensions about the Ukraine crisis and concerns about the Chinese economy weigh on market sentiment.At 7am (AEDT), the local unit was trading at 90.18 US cents, down from 90.28 cents on Monday.President Vladimir Putin's threat to invade Ukraine and take over the Crimea region after a pro-Russian government lost power last month has seen relations between Russia and Western nations continue to deteriorate.Over the weekend, Chinese import and export figures showed an unexpected trade deficit for February after exports fell 18.1 per cent.Westpac New Zealand senior market strategist Imre Speizer said there seemed to be nothing for traders to be happy about at the moment."Markets adopted a slightly pessimistic posture following the weekend's weak China data and continuing tensions in Ukraine," he said."Otherwise, there was no fresh news of significance, limiting volatility overnight."Mr Speizer said he doesn't expect the Australian dollar to fall too much further in the coming weeks, thanks to the Reserve Bank of Australia's stable outlook for the cash rate."However, there remains a question mark around Australia's economy, with tension between strong business sentiment and weak consumer sentiment not expected to be resolved until the second half of this year," he said.Local economic data of interest to markets on Tuesday include the National Australia Bank's monthly business survey for February.


WARSAW, March 10 (Reuters) - Poland's prime minister said on Monday he would ask Chancellor Angela Merkel to work to reduce German and European dependence on Russian gas to avert "potential aggressive steps by Russia in the future".Merkel will visit Poland on Wednesday to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, where Russia has effectively taken control of the southern Crimean peninsula. Events there have highlighted European reliance on Russian oil and gas.Ukraine is a major gas transit nation for supplies from Russia to the European Union(EU), which relies on Russia for over a quarter of its gas."Germany's dependence on Russian gas may effectively decrease Europe's sovereignty. I have no doubts about that," Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference."Increasingly more expensive energy in Europe due to exorbitant climate and environmental ambitions may also mean greater dependence in Russian energy sources...Hence, I will talk (to Merkel) primarily about how Germany is able to correct some economic actions so that dependence on Russian gas doesn't paralyse Europewhen it needs...a decisive stance."Germany has been one of the strongest proponents of increasing the share of renewable energy sources in Europe. Poland gets nearly all its energy from domestically produced coal and has opposed these efforts in the past."The question of Ukraine is a question of EU's future, EU's safety, and a correction of EU's energy policy," Tusk said.Copyright 2017 Thomson Reuters.

Over the years, Vladimir Putin has been building a Russian empire of energy pipelines throughout Europe. In aggregate, Russia provides about a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union, of which over half is carried through pipelines across Ukraine.Building on this powerful energy network, Putin harbours a vision of a "Eurasian Union" to rival the EU. This vision seems to be part of his dream of restoring the lost glories of the former USSR.It is possible that the vision goes beyond Eurasia, to include countries with historical, political or cultural ties, such as Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Vietnam.Ukraine is a lynchpin for Russia's energy supplies to Europe, while Russia's Black Sea Fleet based in Crimea's Sevastopol is the core of Russia's Eurasian power projection. So the loss of Ukraine to the fold of the West would not only threaten Russia's national security but also unravel Putin's Eurasian dream.For the West, Ukraine's about-turn presents a hard-won opening for bringing the country, whose western part is fiercely anti-Russia, into the EU fold - a further step to diminish Russia's stranglehold over Eastern Europe.Russian armed forces are already deployed to Crimea. Will Putin use military force to reverse the status quo in Kiev or occupy pro-Russia eastern Ukraine? This seems unlikely.The people in western Ukraine have clearly spoken. It's no use reclaiming a ticking anti-Russia political time bomb. Moreover, excessive military aggression will backfire on Russia's weak economy, vulnerable to energy demands in Europe. From a cost-benefit perspective, Russian energy supply would seem to be a more effective leverage over Ukraine.The US is warning against Russian military intervention, threatening visa bans and asset freezes. But any response stops short of direct military confrontation, given that America's hands are tied with a war-weary electorate, budget constraints and rising pressures on the US pivot to Asia.Taking advantage of America's military handicap, the EU's dependence on Russian energy, and the anti-Kiev sentiments of Crimea's Russian majority, Putin has moved with lightning speed. The parliament of Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea has proposed holding a referendum on Sunday to determine the region's future. This is presumably to present a fait accompli before the West gets its act together.The Russian president is likely to stick it out in Crimea, waiting for the predictable outcome of the referendum. If the outcome is for joining the Russian Federation, he would approve it, thereby annexing Crimea formally.If the outcome is for Crimea to have much greater autonomy, he is likely to use it as a pretext for strengthening Russia's military presence there, ostensibly to protect Crimea's Russian majority from an anti-Russia Kiev leadership. Either way, Putin is likely to be able to achieve his aim of securing a permanent home for Russia's crucial Black Sea Fleet.Henry Kissinger, writing recently in The Washington Post, has proposed a "Finland model" to solve the Ukrainian crisis, comparing the Scandinavian country's fierce independence while maintaining cordiality with Russia.This consists of: first, letting the Ukrainian people choose their collective future; second, not letting Ukraine into Nato, to avoid provoking Russia; third, leaving Ukraine free to create any government compatible with the will of its people; and fourth, in exchange for Russia's recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty, Crimea's autonomy would be reinforced in elections.Kissinger's formula would help de-escalate the rising tensions. Whether it could ensure that Crimea remains intact under Ukrainian sovereignty remains to be seen. What is clear is that the recent events for Ukraine's future are but moves on a grand chessboard between the West and a resurgent Russia under Putin.Andrew K. P.

Shocking no one, Russia's top natural gas producer, Gazprom, announced last Tuesday that it will cancel a discount on the price it charges for gas in Ukraine.The bargain, a sweet 30% off the price of gas, was a bid by Moscow to deter Ukraine from accepting a trade deal with the EU."This is not linked to politics or anything," Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Tuesday, regarding the discount cancellation.The ongoing Ukraine crisis is often cast as a battle of values, East versus West. But another way of looking at things is to follow the old gas lines.In a nutshell:Ukraine would freeze without Russia.Some 60% of Ukraine's consumed gas comes from Russia. Over the years this reliance has given rise to a so-called gas "mafia" in Kyiv. Ukrainian oligarchs, working closely with Russian suppliers, have taken advantage of the dependency. It is widely believe that these elites siphon money from state coffers and actively prevent Ukraine from developing a sustainable energy sector. All the while, foreign investors are scared away.Similarly, Russian energy supplies help Moscow to keep a firm grip on other former Soviet states like Moldova and Georgia. In September Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin threatened to cut off Moldova's gas supply during the winter if the country continued on its pro-EU economic course. "We hope," said Rogozin to Moldavians, "that you will not freeze."Europe is hooked too.Russia supplies, but Ukraine is the middleman. This helps to explain why some European states (like Germany) have been cagey about imposing sanctions on Russia. Germany and Ukraine are Gazprom's biggest foreign purchasers.Russia is Europe's largest natural gas supplier, supplying about one-third of the continent's natural gas, more than half of which travels through Ukraine. Important pipelines pass through Ukraine to Slovakia, and then on to Germany, Italy and Austria.So, what would happen if Russia switched off the Ukrainian pipes? Actually it has done just that twice over the last decade, in 2006 and again in 2009, amid pricing disputes between Kyiv and Moscow. The result: gas shortages in several European countries.Already Europe is working to wean itself off Russian supplies. Ukraine's woes might help to speed up that process.It's a two-way street.Russia needs Europe too. Oil and gas trade accounts for half of Russia's annual export revenue and more than half of Russia's federal budget.Important to note is that many of Russia's important gas pipelines go through Western Ukraine, which is decidedly pro-Europe."I would argue that Russia has more to lose than Europe at the moment," says Tim Boersma of the Brookings Institution. "Russia needs European demands. It is making roughly $100 million a day from hydrocarbons.What about America?Washington is making moves. The U.S. doesn't export natural gas yet. But congressional Republicans especially are calling to loosen U.S. export restrictions, with the idea that if Washington puts more gas on the market, it can (economically) cut Russia down to size.The U.S. Department of Energy is issuing permits to American corporations that will let them start exporting gas in 2015.Fun fact: Who is now leading the U.S. State Department's new Bureau of Energy Resources? It's Carlos Pascual, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.So what about that new global order?In recent weeks Eurasia experts and political hacks have been talking big about a new global energy order inspired by events in Ukraine.Chaos in Ukraine, goes this logic, will threaten natural gas supplies and push Europe to look for non-Russian gas sources.It's already happening. U.S. energy behemoth Halliburton Co. will soon start fracking in Poland. Royal Dutch Shell will start hunting for natural gas in Ukraine next year.In fact, Europe is already way less energy-dependent on Russia than it was in 2009, the last time Moscow switched off the Ukrainian pipelines. Germany, for instance, has found alternative energy sources in Norway and Algeria.2009 was a turning point. And 2014 could be Russia's biggest mistake yet.

WARSAW (AFP) - Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas poses a threat to European sovereignty, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned Monday amid rising East-West tensions over Ukraine."Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty. I have no doubt," Mr Tusk told reporters, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.The top European economy buys around one third of its oil and gas from Russia and has extensive trade and investment links with the vast country to the east.Germany has tried to defuse the Western standoff with Moscow over Ukraine, but analysts say its voice is muted by fears of endangering its economic ties with Russia."The Ukraine issue is a matter of the future security of the European Union," Mr Tusk said on a visit to a military base in northern Poland to mark 15 years since his ex-communist nation joined the Nato defence alliance.The 28-member EU needs to review its energy policy, he added, ahead of Ms Merkel's Wednesday visit."I'll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole," he said."I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money," Mr Tusk said. "This, of course, applies not just to Germany, but in recent years Germany has been a strong example of this phenomenon," he added.Mr Tusk said talks with Ms Merkel would also focus on "how Germany could revise certain economic decisions, to avoid the paralysis of Europe at a time when it must act quickly and adopt a clear stance".Washington on Friday played down the risk posed to the European economy by Russia's threat to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, insisting the region had adequate stocks.Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.Washington, which backs Ukraine's interim government and opposes Moscow's moves to seize the Crimean peninsula, said any gas embargo would hurt Moscow as much as Kiev.

LONDON, March 10 (UPI) -- British utility companies shouldn't use the crisis over Ukraine as an excuse to raise consumer energy prices, British Energy Secretary Ed Davey said.European consumers are wary of a repeat of a 2009 gas contract dispute between Ukraine and Russian energy company Gazprom that resulted in a brief supply disruption. With Russia frustrated with recent political developments in Ukraine, Davey warned utility companies against raising prices in response to the crisis."Companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance," he was quoted by the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph as saying Sunday. "So they shouldn't be using [the Ukrainian crisis] as an excuse to put up people's prices."European consumers get about a quarter of their gas needs met by Russia. Most of that runs through the Soviet-era transit network in Ukraine.Davey said there was an increase in oil and gas prices on the international market in response to the row, which erupted in November when ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych backed out of a trade deal with the European Union."They've now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices," he said.

Aust dollar weaker in early tradeThe Australian dollar has lost ground as tensions about the Ukraine crisis and concerns about the Chinese economy weigh on market sentiment.At 7am (AEDT), the local unit was trading at 90.18 US cents, down from 90.28 cents on Monday.President Vladimir Putin's threat to invade Ukraine and take over the Crimea region after a pro-Russian government lost power last month has seen relations between Russia and Western nations continue to deteriorate.Over the weekend, Chinese import and export figures showed an unexpected trade deficit for February after exports fell 18.1 per cent.Westpac New Zealand senior market strategist Imre Speizer said there seemed to be nothing for traders to be happy about at the moment."Markets adopted a slightly pessimistic posture following the weekend's weak China data and continuing tensions in Ukraine," he said."Otherwise, there was no fresh news of significance, limiting volatility overnight."Mr Speizer said he doesn't expect the Australian dollar to fall too much further in the coming weeks, thanks to the Reserve Bank of Australia's stable outlook for the cash rate."However, there remains a question mark around Australia's economy, with tension between strong business sentiment and weak consumer sentiment not expected to be resolved until the second half of this year," he said.Local economic data of interest to markets on Tuesday include the National Australia Bank's monthly business survey for February.
WARSAW, March 10 (Reuters) - Poland's prime minister said on Monday he would ask Chancellor Angela Merkel to work to reduce German and European dependence on Russian gas to avert "potential aggressive steps by Russia in the future".Merkel will visit Poland on Wednesday to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, where Russia has effectively taken control of the southern Crimean peninsula. Events there have highlighted European reliance on Russian oil and gas.Ukraine is a major gas transit nation for supplies from Russia to the European Union(EU), which relies on Russia for over a quarter of its gas."Germany's dependence on Russian gas may effectively decrease Europe's sovereignty. I have no doubts about that," Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference."Increasingly more expensive energy in Europe due to exorbitant climate and environmental ambitions may also mean greater dependence in Russian energy sources...Hence, I will talk (to Merkel) primarily about how Germany is able to correct some economic actions so that dependence on Russian gas doesn't paralyse Europewhen it needs...a decisive stance."Germany has been one of the strongest proponents of increasing the share of renewable energy sources in Europe. Poland gets nearly all its energy from domestically produced coal and has opposed these efforts in the past."The question of Ukraine is a question of EU's future, EU's safety, and a correction of EU's energy policy," Tusk said.Copyright 2017 Thomson Reuters.

LONDON, March 10 (UPI) -- British utility companies shouldn't use the crisis over Ukraine as an excuse to raise consumer energy prices, British Energy Secretary Ed Davey said.European consumers are wary of a repeat of a 2009 gas contract dispute between Ukraine and Russian energy company Gazprom that resulted in a brief supply disruption. With Russia frustrated with recent political developments in Ukraine, Davey warned utility companies against raising prices in response to the crisis."Companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance," he was quoted by the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph as saying Sunday. "So they shouldn't be using [the Ukrainian crisis] as an excuse to put up people's prices."European consumers get about a quarter of their gas needs met by Russia. Most of that runs through the Soviet-era transit network in Ukraine.Davey said there was an increase in oil and gas prices on the international market in response to the row, which erupted in November when ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych backed out of a trade deal with the European Union."They've now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices," he said.
Shocking no one, Russia's top natural gas producer, Gazprom, announced last Tuesday that it will cancel a discount on the price it charges for gas in Ukraine.The bargain, a sweet 30% off the price of gas, was a bid by Moscow to deter Ukraine from accepting a trade deal with the EU."This is not linked to politics or anything," Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Tuesday, regarding the discount cancellation.The ongoing Ukraine crisis is often cast as a battle of values, East versus West. But another way of looking at things is to follow the old gas lines.In a nutshell:Ukraine would freeze without Russia.Some 60% of Ukraine's consumed gas comes from Russia. Over the years this reliance has given rise to a so-called gas "mafia" in Kyiv. Ukrainian oligarchs, working closely with Russian suppliers, have taken advantage of the dependency. It is widely believe that these elites siphon money from state coffers and actively prevent Ukraine from developing a sustainable energy sector. All the while, foreign investors are scared away.Similarly, Russian energy supplies help Moscow to keep a firm grip on other former Soviet states like Moldova and Georgia. In September Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin threatened to cut off Moldova's gas supply during the winter if the country continued on its pro-EU economic course. "We hope," said Rogozin to Moldavians, "that you will not freeze."Europe is hooked too.Russia supplies, but Ukraine is the middleman. This helps to explain why some European states (like Germany) have been cagey about imposing sanctions on Russia. Germany and Ukraine are Gazprom's biggest foreign purchasers.Russia is Europe's largest natural gas supplier, supplying about one-third of the continent's natural gas, more than half of which travels through Ukraine. Important pipelines pass through Ukraine to Slovakia, and then on to Germany, Italy and Austria.So, what would happen if Russia switched off the Ukrainian pipes? Actually it has done just that twice over the last decade, in 2006 and again in 2009, amid pricing disputes between Kyiv and Moscow. The result: gas shortages in several European countries.Already Europe is working to wean itself off Russian supplies. Ukraine's woes might help to speed up that process.It's a two-way street.Russia needs Europe too. Oil and gas trade accounts for half of Russia's annual export revenue and more than half of Russia's federal budget.Important to note is that many of Russia's important gas pipelines go through Western Ukraine, which is decidedly pro-Europe."I would argue that Russia has more to lose than Europe at the moment," says Tim Boersma of the Brookings Institution. "Russia needs European demands. It is making roughly $100 million a day from hydrocarbons.What about America?Washington is making moves. The U.S. doesn't export natural gas yet. But congressional Republicans especially are calling to loosen U.S. export restrictions, with the idea that if Washington puts more gas on the market, it can (economically) cut Russia down to size.The U.S. Department of Energy is issuing permits to American corporations that will let them start exporting gas in 2015.Fun fact: Who is now leading the U.S. State Department's new Bureau of Energy Resources? It's Carlos Pascual, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.So what about that new global order?In recent weeks Eurasia experts and political hacks have been talking big about a new global energy order inspired by events in Ukraine.Chaos in Ukraine, goes this logic, will threaten natural gas supplies and push Europe to look for non-Russian gas sources.It's already happening. U.S. energy behemoth Halliburton Co. will soon start fracking in Poland. Royal Dutch Shell will start hunting for natural gas in Ukraine next year.In fact, Europe is already way less energy-dependent on Russia than it was in 2009, the last time Moscow switched off the Ukrainian pipelines. Germany, for instance, has found alternative energy sources in Norway and Algeria.2009 was a turning point. And 2014 could be Russia's biggest mistake yet.

Over the years, Vladimir Putin has been building a Russian empire of energy pipelines throughout Europe. In aggregate, Russia provides about a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union, of which over half is carried through pipelines across Ukraine.Building on this powerful energy network, Putin harbours a vision of a "Eurasian Union" to rival the EU. This vision seems to be part of his dream of restoring the lost glories of the former USSR.It is possible that the vision goes beyond Eurasia, to include countries with historical, political or cultural ties, such as Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Vietnam.Ukraine is a lynchpin for Russia's energy supplies to Europe, while Russia's Black Sea Fleet based in Crimea's Sevastopol is the core of Russia's Eurasian power projection. So the loss of Ukraine to the fold of the West would not only threaten Russia's national security but also unravel Putin's Eurasian dream.For the West, Ukraine's about-turn presents a hard-won opening for bringing the country, whose western part is fiercely anti-Russia, into the EU fold - a further step to diminish Russia's stranglehold over Eastern Europe.Russian armed forces are already deployed to Crimea. Will Putin use military force to reverse the status quo in Kiev or occupy pro-Russia eastern Ukraine? This seems unlikely.The people in western Ukraine have clearly spoken. It's no use reclaiming a ticking anti-Russia political time bomb. Moreover, excessive military aggression will backfire on Russia's weak economy, vulnerable to energy demands in Europe. From a cost-benefit perspective, Russian energy supply would seem to be a more effective leverage over Ukraine.The US is warning against Russian military intervention, threatening visa bans and asset freezes. But any response stops short of direct military confrontation, given that America's hands are tied with a war-weary electorate, budget constraints and rising pressures on the US pivot to Asia.Taking advantage of America's military handicap, the EU's dependence on Russian energy, and the anti-Kiev sentiments of Crimea's Russian majority, Putin has moved with lightning speed. The parliament of Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea has proposed holding a referendum on Sunday to determine the region's future. This is presumably to present a fait accompli before the West gets its act together.The Russian president is likely to stick it out in Crimea, waiting for the predictable outcome of the referendum. If the outcome is for joining the Russian Federation, he would approve it, thereby annexing Crimea formally.If the outcome is for Crimea to have much greater autonomy, he is likely to use it as a pretext for strengthening Russia's military presence there, ostensibly to protect Crimea's Russian majority from an anti-Russia Kiev leadership. Either way, Putin is likely to be able to achieve his aim of securing a permanent home for Russia's crucial Black Sea Fleet.Henry Kissinger, writing recently in The Washington Post, has proposed a "Finland model" to solve the Ukrainian crisis, comparing the Scandinavian country's fierce independence while maintaining cordiality with Russia.This consists of: first, letting the Ukrainian people choose their collective future; second, not letting Ukraine into Nato, to avoid provoking Russia; third, leaving Ukraine free to create any government compatible with the will of its people; and fourth, in exchange for Russia's recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty, Crimea's autonomy would be reinforced in elections.Kissinger's formula would help de-escalate the rising tensions. Whether it could ensure that Crimea remains intact under Ukrainian sovereignty remains to be seen. What is clear is that the recent events for Ukraine's future are but moves on a grand chessboard between the West and a resurgent Russia under Putin.Andrew K. P.

Either way, Putin is likely to be able to achieve his aim of securing a permanent home for Russia's crucial Black Sea Fleet.Henry Kissinger, writing recently in The Washington Post, has proposed a "Finland model" to solve the Ukrainian crisis, comparing the Scandinavian country's fierce independence while maintaining cordiality with Russia.This consists of: first, letting the Ukrainian people choose their collective future; second, not letting Ukraine into Nato, to avoid provoking Russia; third, leaving Ukraine free to create any government compatible with the will of its people; and fourth, in exchange for Russia's recognition of Ukraine's sovereignty, Crimea's autonomy would be reinforced in elections.Kissinger's formula would help de-escalate the rising tensions. Whether it could ensure that Crimea remains intact under Ukrainian sovereignty remains to be seen. What is clear is that the recent events for Ukraine's future are but moves on a grand chessboard between the West and a resurgent Russia under Putin.Andrew K. P.

WARSAW, March 10 (Reuters) - Poland's prime minister said on Monday he would ask Chancellor Angela Merkel to work to reduce German and European dependence on Russian gas to avert "potential aggressive steps by Russia in the future".Merkel will visit Poland on Wednesday to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, where Russia has effectively taken control of the southern Crimean peninsula.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2015 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.Visit performance for information about the performance numbers displayed above.Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.Real time prices by BATS.

Shocking no one, Russia's top natural gas producer, Gazprom, announced last Tuesday that it will cancel a discount on the price it charges for gas in Ukraine.The bargain, a sweet 30% off the price of gas, was a bid by Moscow to deter Ukraine from accepting a trade deal with the EU."This is not linked to politics or anything," Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Tuesday, regarding the discount cancellation.The ongoing Ukraine crisis is often cast as a battle of values, East versus West. But another way of looking at things is to follow the old gas lines.In a nutshell:Ukraine would freeze without Russia.Some 60% of Ukraine's consumed gas comes from Russia. Over the years this reliance has given rise to a so-called gas "mafia" in Kyiv. Ukrainian oligarchs, working closely with Russian suppliers, have taken advantage of the dependency. It is widely believe that these elites siphon money from state coffers and actively prevent Ukraine from developing a sustainable energy sector. All the while, foreign investors are scared away.Similarly, Russian energy supplies help Moscow to keep a firm grip on other former Soviet states like Moldova and Georgia. In September Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin threatened to cut off Moldova's gas supply during the winter if the country continued on its pro-EU economic course. "We hope," said Rogozin to Moldavians, "that you will not freeze."Europe is hooked too.Russia supplies, but Ukraine is the middleman. This helps to explain why some European states (like Germany) have been cagey about imposing sanctions on Russia. Germany and Ukraine are Gazprom's biggest foreign purchasers.Russia is Europe's largest natural gas supplier, supplying about one-third of the continent's natural gas, more than half of which travels through Ukraine. Important pipelines pass through Ukraine to Slovakia, and then on to Germany, Italy and Austria.So, what would happen if Russia switched off the Ukrainian pipes?

LONDON, March 10 (UPI) -- British utility companies shouldn't use the crisis over Ukraine as an excuse to raise consumer energy prices, British Energy Secretary Ed Davey said.European consumers are wary of a repeat of a 2009 gas contract dispute between Ukraine and Russian energy company Gazprom that resulted in a brief supply disruption. With Russia frustrated with recent political developments in Ukraine, Davey warned utility companies against raising prices in response to the crisis."Companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance," he was quoted by the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph as saying Sunday. "So they shouldn't be using [the Ukrainian crisis] as an excuse to put up people's prices."European consumers get about a quarter of their gas needs met by Russia. Most of that runs through the Soviet-era transit network in Ukraine.Davey said there was an increase in oil and gas prices on the international market in response to the row, which erupted in November when ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych backed out of a trade deal with the European Union."They've now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices," he said.

Germany, for instance, has found alternative energy sources in Norway and Algeria.2009 was a turning point. And 2014 could be Russia's biggest mistake yet.

Over the years, Vladimir Putin has been building a Russian empire of energy pipelines throughout Europe. In aggregate, Russia provides about a quarter of the natural gas consumed in the European Union, of which over half is carried through pipelines across Ukraine.Building on this powerful energy network, Putin harbours a vision of a "Eurasian Union" to rival the EU. This vision seems to be part of his dream of restoring the lost glories of the former USSR.It is possible that the vision goes beyond Eurasia, to include countries with historical, political or cultural ties, such as Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Vietnam.Ukraine is a lynchpin for Russia's energy supplies to Europe, while Russia's Black Sea Fleet based in Crimea's Sevastopol is the core of Russia's Eurasian power projection. So the loss of Ukraine to the fold of the West would not only threaten Russia's national security but also unravel Putin's Eurasian dream.For the West, Ukraine's about-turn presents a hard-won opening for bringing the country, whose western part is fiercely anti-Russia, into the EU fold - a further step to diminish Russia's stranglehold over Eastern Europe.Russian armed forces are already deployed to Crimea. Will Putin use military force to reverse the status quo in Kiev or occupy pro-Russia eastern Ukraine? This seems unlikely.The people in western Ukraine have clearly spoken. It's no use reclaiming a ticking anti-Russia political time bomb. Moreover, excessive military aggression will backfire on Russia's weak economy, vulnerable to energy demands in Europe. From a cost-benefit perspective, Russian energy supply would seem to be a more effective leverage over Ukraine.The US is warning against Russian military intervention, threatening visa bans and asset freezes. But any response stops short of direct military confrontation, given that America's hands are tied with a war-weary electorate, budget constraints and rising pressures on the US pivot to Asia.Taking advantage of America's military handicap, the EU's dependence on Russian energy, and the anti-Kiev sentiments of Crimea's Russian majority, Putin has moved with lightning speed. The parliament of Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea has proposed holding a referendum on Sunday to determine the region's future. This is presumably to present a fait accompli before the West gets its act together.The Russian president is likely to stick it out in Crimea, waiting for the predictable outcome of the referendum. If the outcome is for joining the Russian Federation, he would approve it, thereby annexing Crimea formally.If the outcome is for Crimea to have much greater autonomy, he is likely to use it as a pretext for strengthening Russia's military presence there, ostensibly to protect Crimea's Russian majority from an anti-Russia Kiev leadership.

DUBLIN (AP) -- Yes, they have more bananas.Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world's biggest banana supplier.The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66).Fyffes rose 46 percent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York.Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.David McCann, Fyffes' chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.Lonergan said their "natural strategic partnership" would "provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice."However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.

Something rotten is going on off the state of Sweden. A foreign something, nobody is sure what, has been reported floating close to Stockholm. Could be a submarine, could be a man in black, which begs a question how big is the man, or small the submarine. Well, must be a really big one if the Swedish navy has declared the area off limits to civilian navigation, and the skies above have been designated a no fly zone, as if the Baltic country is next to Syria or Libya. But small enough to be found in four days of a massive search.

Chiquita To Become Top Banana With $526M Fyffes MergerLaw360, New York (March 10, 2014, 3:37 PM EDT) -- Chiquita Brands International Inc. agreed to merge with Fyffes PLC in a stock swap worth $526 million, creating the world's largest banana company, the fruit distributors said Monday.If approved by regulators by the end of the year, the resulting entity will have $1.07 billion in combined value, the companies said. Both are international, though Chiquita has a heavy presence in the Americas while Fyffes, headquartered in Dublin, is especially well-positioned to market in Europe. Together, they will have a workforce of 32,000 people."This is...To view the full article, register now.

DUBLIN (AP) -- Yes, they have more bananas.Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world's biggest banana supplier.The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte. ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday's deal valued Fyffes shares at 1.22 euros ($1.66).Fyffes rose 46 percent to 1.30 euros ($1.80) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York.Fyffes, pronounced 'Fifes', is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.David McCann, Fyffes' chairman, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chairman.Lonergan said their "natural strategic partnership" would "provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice."However, shoppers used to seeing bananas bearing the bold blue stickers of Chiquita or Fyffes aren't expected to notice any difference there. The two brands are staying separate.

Something rotten is going on off the state of Sweden. A foreign something, nobody is sure what, has been reported floating close to Stockholm. Could be a submarine, could be a man in black, which begs a question how big is the man, or small the submarine. Well, must be a really big one if the Swedish navy has declared the area off limits to civilian navigation, and the skies above have been designated a no fly zone, as if the Baltic country is next to Syria or Libya. But small enough to be found in four days of a massive search.

After two years, Central China Securities has scrapped its plans for an initial public offering in Shanghai as the mainland brokerage believes it will be easier and quicker to raise up to US$400 million in Hong Kong.The mid-sized firm, based in Henan province, appeared on the global radar in 2008 when it announced with Wall Street bank Citigroup a plan to set up an investment banking joint venture.The plan was later scrapped as Citigroup decided to team up with other local partners.Central China Securities had hired CCB International, the Hong Kong-based investment banking arm of China Construction Bank, one of the Big Four state-run banks headquartered in Beijing, to be the lead sponsor for its upcoming offer in Hong Kong, people familiar with the situation said.The firm had not yet formally applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for the listing, but it aimed to launch it within two months, the sources said."It will definitely be in the first half of this year," one of them said. "The market environment changes quickly, and the key is to get listed as soon as you can."Central China Securities' plans for a Hong Kong float came as a surprise to some industry executives, but others said it reflected the new thinking at the mainland's securities regulator.During the annual meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the industry watchdog might abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the regulator.This would make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the future.Yao's remark is good news for capital-hungry mainland firms facing a nationwide downturn in economic growth, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a large backlog from the recently lifted 15-month suspension of listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses."Timing means everything in the financial business," said another source. "Central China Securities has sort of wasted two years in preparing its plan for a Shanghai IPO, and as it has been proven to be much easier to list in Hong Kong, then why not?"The trick to getting a company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days: first, secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half the shares in the flotation.That is why some bankers joke that Hong Kong's listing market looks more like a series of private placements these days.Mainland brokerages are no strangers to the Hong Kong stock market. Top-tier players such as Citic Securities and Haitong Securities have listed in the city in the past few years. So have mainland banks, including all the Big Four.



After two years, Central China Securities has scrapped its plans for an initial public offering in Shanghai as the mainland brokerage believes it will be easier and quicker to raise up to US$400 million in Hong Kong.The mid-sized firm, based in Henan province, appeared on the global radar in 2008 when it announced with Wall Street bank Citigroup a plan to set up an investment banking joint venture.The plan was later scrapped as Citigroup decided to team up with other local partners.Central China Securities had hired CCB International, the Hong Kong-based investment banking arm of China Construction Bank, one of the Big Four state-run banks headquartered in Beijing, to be the lead sponsor for its upcoming offer in Hong Kong, people familiar with the situation said.The firm had not yet formally applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for the listing, but it aimed to launch it within two months, the sources said."It will definitely be in the first half of this year," one of them said. "The market environment changes quickly, and the key is to get listed as soon as you can."Central China Securities' plans for a Hong Kong float came as a surprise to some industry executives, but others said it reflected the new thinking at the mainland's securities regulator.During the annual meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the industry watchdog might abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the regulator.This would make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the future.Yao's remark is good news for capital-hungry mainland firms facing a nationwide downturn in economic growth, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a large backlog from the recently lifted 15-month suspension of listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses."Timing means everything in the financial business," said another source.

"As long as you can meet the listing requirements of the Hong Kong stock exchange, you should definitely go there."That was the clear message from one of the most senior stock market regulators on the mainland when asked about the funding needs of small-sized, capital-hungry private enterprises.During the once-a-year political summit in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the mainland's stock market watchdog may simply abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the CSRC.

But is this really good news for Hong Kong?The Hong Kong stock exchange may welcome the move as more IPOs from the north could strengthen the city's position as a global capital-raising centre - it was the world's No2 destination for IPOs in terms of total amount raised last year. The New York stock exchange was in first place.Investment bankers will also welcome the move for sure. The more IPOs, the more fees they get, and that also means bigger bonuses. However, let's consider the quality of the IPOs rather than the quantity.Last week in Beijing Yao encouraged the nation's small and medium-sized private enterprises to first consider Hong Kong, not Shanghai or Shenzhen, for listing partly because of the widely accepted assumption in the financial industry that small firms have an easier time raising money here than on the mainland.He also indicated that large state-owned enterprises, although they have the freedom to come to Hong Kong for IPOs, should still consider domestic listings as their first choice. Fund managers say Yao's comments are in line with Beijing's long-term stance that quality blue-chip companies should list domestically so mainland investors can first share in their business success, and perhaps enjoy fat dividends as well.Then what about Hong Kong? By welcoming these smaller firms from the north, which may find it hard to raise money at home, are we turning the Hong Kong stock market into a rubbish bin, or are we just Plan B for those who cannot list at home.The trick to getting any company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days; just secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half your IPO shares.

China significantly weakens yuanChina's central bank weakened the daily reference rate for its currency by the largest percentage in more than a year and a half, continuing a push to drive the yuan lower.As sluggish economic news sent jitters through the market, the People's Bank of China set the daily reference rate Monday at 6.1312 to the US dollar, compared with 6.1201 to the US dollar on Friday. The 0.18 per cent change represented the largest one-day move in the rate since July 2012.The central bank determines the rate each day, and then allows the currency to trade as much as 1 per cent higher or lower. Since 2005, it has gradually moved the rate up, allowing the yuan to strengthen 33 per cent, but in the last month has pushed it lower, seeking to discourage speculators who have channeled money into the economy in hopes of benefiting from the currency's rise.The US dollar-Chinese yuan pair was fixed "much higher than what the market environment would have otherwise suggested," said Sacha Tihanyi, a senior currency strategist at Scotiabank in Hong Kong. This suggests, he said, that the yuan is heading back to weaker levels it hit against the greenback a few weeks ago.Mr Tihanyi says the move to set the yuan weaker isn't a reaction by policy makers to news Saturday that China recorded a rare trade deficit in February, but is an element of a broader effort by the central bank to overhaul the financial system. Beijing is seeking to make it clear to investors that the yuan isn't a one-way bet, laying the groundwork for allowing the currency to trade more freely.Premier Li Keqiang said last week at the National People's Congress, China's annual legislative session, that Beijing would expand the currency-trading band.The trade figures, as well as disappointing news about inflation released over the weekend, weren't surprising and reflect seasonal factors, analysts and strategists said. Exports plummeted, leaving the world's second-largest economy with a $US22.9 billion ($A25.2bn) monthly trade deficit, its first since early last year. Imports, however, were up 10.1 per cent from a year earlier, pointing to undamaged Chinese demand."We aren't surprised by the trade deficit in February, as China used to record a deficit in February or March in recent years and we don't think there is a big chance China will post a deficit again in March," said Huang Yi, head of currencies and commodities of China Guangfa Bank.Mr Huang said that while the deficit has changed some investors' and institutions' short-term expectations, the selloff in the yuan wasn't overwhelming. The "two-way" movement will persist in the short run, he said.Analysts note that volatility in the currency has risen dramatically over the past few weeks from record lows, after the yuan spooked market participants with an unexpected 1.3 per cent tumble in late February and early March. The yuan usually barely budges; it gained 2.9 per cent in all of 2013.On Monday, the yuan touched 6.1458 against the dollar, compared with 6.1260 late Friday in New York. The offshore yuan, which is freely traded outside China, fell as low as 6.1309 from 6.1095 on Friday.Some say while the weekend's economic news was a factor behind the decision to change the reference rate, Chinese policy makers have taken the news as an opportunity to prompt caution in the market and shake out speculators who have driven money into China."We expect that the trade figures will be more real in the coming months as the [yuan] has become much more volatile and less predictable than before," economists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. wrote in a note on March 8. The gap, or spread, between interest rates in the onshore and offshore markets is narrowing, potentially deterring people from pumping money into mainland China to take advantage of high yields in the onshore market, they said.

Insurers from Hong Kong and other overseas markets are lobbying mainland authorities for permission to sell products in Guangdong province after finding it hard to compete with domestic players, according to industry players.Chan Kin-por, legislator for the insurance sector, told the South China Morning Post that he and some officials from the Office of Commissioner of Insurance recently urged mainland authorities in Qianhai and Guangdong to allow Hong Kong-based insurers to use their Hong Kong agents to sell products to residents there. They also pressed for more flexible product approvals."Over more than 20 years of development, foreign insurers still find it hard to compete in the mainland insurance market where combined they have less than 4 per cent of the market," Chan said, adding that part of the reason was that domestic rivals had more sales agents.He said foreign insurers found it hard to bring their best-selling products to mainland customers."Unlike Hong Kong where insurers can freely introduce any new insurance products, in China all insurance companies must first get regulatory approval before any new product launch. The regulator does not approve overseas insurers bringing in innovative insurance products to the mainland and that prevents them competing with new products," Chan said.Manuel Bauer, a board member of German insurer Allianz, one of the first batch of foreign insurers in 1999, said it would be tough to compete with mainland insurers."The domestic mainland insurance companies are so dominant that it is a mission impossible for the foreign insurance [company]," Bauer told the South China Morning Post during a visit to Hong Kong last week.Total gross premiums for foreign insurance companies last year stood at 67.99 billion yuan (HK$86.04 billion), representing only 3.9 per cent of the market, with the rest taken by domestic insurers, according to data from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.Bauer said Allianz would continue to expand on the mainland where it sells a wide range of policies including life, pension, motor insurance and asset management products. The firm's total gross premiums in China rose 30 per cent last year.Despite the low market share, foreign insurers experienced strong growth in mainland sales and future prospects were bright, he said. All foreign life insurance firms in China posted 25.56 per cent growth in premium income last year while all foreign general insurers saw a 23.63 per cent gain in premiums, government statistics showed."China has a huge population. The country is still in its early stage of development in the insurance market," said Bauer. "Its insurance penetration rate is lower than in other international markets. This provides a lot of room for growth."Swiss Re said premiums in mainland China in 2012 represented only 2.96 per cent of its gross domestic product, against 8.18 per cent in the United States, 11.27 per cent in Britain, 12.44 per cent in Hong Kong and 18.19 per cent in Taiwan.

"As long as you can meet the listing requirements of the Hong Kong stock exchange, you should definitely go there."That was the clear message from one of the most senior stock market regulators on the mainland when asked about the funding needs of small-sized, capital-hungry private enterprises.During the once-a-year political summit in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the mainland's stock market watchdog may simply abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the CSRC. This will make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the foreseeable future.The trick to getting any company listed is secure so-called cornerstone investorsYao's comment is certainly good news for mainland firms fighting the nationwide economic downturn, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a 15-month suspension of domestic listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen where the mainland's two national bourses are based. But is this really good news for Hong Kong?The Hong Kong stock exchange may welcome the move as more IPOs from the north could strengthen the city's position as a global capital-raising centre - it was the world's No2 destination for IPOs in terms of total amount raised last year. The New York stock exchange was in first place.Investment bankers will also welcome the move for sure. The more IPOs, the more fees they get, and that also means bigger bonuses. However, let's consider the quality of the IPOs rather than the quantity.Last week in Beijing Yao encouraged the nation's small and medium-sized private enterprises to first consider Hong Kong, not Shanghai or Shenzhen, for listing partly because of the widely accepted assumption in the financial industry that small firms have an easier time raising money here than on the mainland.He also indicated that large state-owned enterprises, although they have the freedom to come to Hong Kong for IPOs, should still consider domestic listings as their first choice. Fund managers say Yao's comments are in line with Beijing's long-term stance that quality blue-chip companies should list domestically so mainland investors can first share in their business success, and perhaps enjoy fat dividends as well.Then what about Hong Kong? By welcoming these smaller firms from the north, which may find it hard to raise money at home, are we turning the Hong Kong stock market into a rubbish bin, or are we just Plan B for those who cannot list at home.The trick to getting any company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days; just secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half your IPO shares. That's why some bankers joke that Hong Kong's IPO market looks more like a series of private placements these days.An IPO should be a new beginning, not the end, for any responsible, listed company.

SYDNEY: Shanghai copper dropped by its 5 percent daily limit on Monday to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country's first domestic bond default last week.China's exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.This inflamed worries about appetite, as demand from Chinese consumers has yet to regain steam after the new year break. London copper prices slid to within a whisker of nearly three-year lows, after shedding nearly 4 percent on Friday."Fundamental demand has not resumed to normal levels yet," said analyst Chunlan Li of minerals consultancy CRU in Beijing."We are still waiting to see demand resume, maybe after mid-March -- there's still a chance it will happen."The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent to 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne, its lowest since Sept. 2009.Across the board, heavy selling in Shanghai metals contracts spilled into the new week, with ShFE aluminium hitting a 5-year low, ShFE lead a contract low and ShFE zinc sliding to its weakest in more than four months.Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange had dropped 1.1 percent to $6,709.25 a tonne by 0256 GMT.It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010.But other LME contracts, many with stronger fundamentals than copper this year, held their ground, slipping to multi-week rather than multi-month or year lows.Reflecting ample supply, copper premiums in Shanghai bond have fallen by $20 to $140-$160 from late January, according to China price provider Shmet.China is the world's top user of copper, accounting for 45 percent of global demand. But much of its imports are used for financing, where shipments are sold on domestic markets to raise funds for investment in higher yielding assets like real estate.Worries these deals could unravel flustered traders on Friday after China recorded its first domestic bond default when loss-making solar equipment producer Chaori Solar missed an interest payment, setting a landmark for market discipline in the world's second-largest economy.The default is widely expected to force a re-pricing of credit risk that could pile pressure on weak borrowers.Industries such as metals and mining, shipbuilding and materials are seen as key sectors with high default risks.Li said that there was a substantial risk that sliding property market values or spreading debt market contagion could force copper financing deals to unravel."But I think it's not this year. The government is still expecting a stable slowdown, not a sharp slowdown - clearly real estate is heavily relevant to economic growth."Elsewhere, US job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.Hedge funds and money managers turned copper markets into a net short in the week to March 4, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday.Also curtailing risk appetite, were worries about escalating tensions in Ukraine. Germany's Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine's constitution.

Lululemon CEO 'buying as much stock as we can' after shares plunge
Insurers from Hong Kong and other overseas markets are lobbying mainland authorities for permission to sell products in Guangdong province after finding it hard to compete with domestic players, according to industry players.Chan Kin-por, legislator for the insurance sector, told the South China Morning Post that he and some officials from the Office of Commissioner of Insurance recently urged mainland authorities in Qianhai and Guangdong to allow Hong Kong-based insurers to use their Hong Kong agents to sell products to residents there. They also pressed for more flexible product approvals."Over more than 20 years of development, foreign insurers still find it hard to compete in the mainland insurance market where combined they have less than 4 per cent of the market," Chan said, adding that part of the reason was that domestic rivals had more sales agents.He said foreign insurers found it hard to bring their best-selling products to mainland customers."Unlike Hong Kong where insurers can freely introduce any new insurance products, in China all insurance companies must first get regulatory approval before any new product launch. The regulator does not approve overseas insurers bringing in innovative insurance products to the mainland and that prevents them competing with new products," Chan said.Manuel Bauer, a board member of German insurer Allianz, one of the first batch of foreign insurers in 1999, said it would be tough to compete with mainland insurers."The domestic mainland insurance companies are so dominant that it is a mission impossible for the foreign insurance [company]," Bauer told the South China Morning Post during a visit to Hong Kong last week.Total gross premiums for foreign insurance companies last year stood at 67.99 billion yuan (HK$86.04 billion), representing only 3.9 per cent of the market, with the rest taken by domestic insurers, according to data from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.Bauer said Allianz would continue to expand on the mainland where it sells a wide range of policies including life, pension, motor insurance and asset management products. The firm's total gross premiums in China rose 30 per cent last year.Despite the low market share, foreign insurers experienced strong growth in mainland sales and future prospects were bright, he said. All foreign life insurance firms in China posted 25.56 per cent growth in premium income last year while all foreign general insurers saw a 23.63 per cent gain in premiums, government statistics showed."China has a huge population. The country is still in its early stage of development in the insurance market," said Bauer. "Its insurance penetration rate is lower than in other international markets. This provides a lot of room for growth."Swiss Re said premiums in mainland China in 2012 represented only 2.96 per cent of its gross domestic product, against 8.18 per cent in the United States, 11.27 per cent in Britain, 12.44 per cent in Hong Kong and 18.19 per cent in Taiwan.

China significantly weakens yuanChina's central bank weakened the daily reference rate for its currency by the largest percentage in more than a year and a half, continuing a push to drive the yuan lower.As sluggish economic news sent jitters through the market, the People's Bank of China set the daily reference rate Monday at 6.1312 to the US dollar, compared with 6.1201 to the US dollar on Friday. The 0.18 per cent change represented the largest one-day move in the rate since July 2012.The central bank determines the rate each day, and then allows the currency to trade as much as 1 per cent higher or lower. Since 2005, it has gradually moved the rate up, allowing the yuan to strengthen 33 per cent, but in the last month has pushed it lower, seeking to discourage speculators who have channeled money into the economy in hopes of benefiting from the currency's rise.The US dollar-Chinese yuan pair was fixed "much higher than what the market environment would have otherwise suggested," said Sacha Tihanyi, a senior currency strategist at Scotiabank in Hong Kong. This suggests, he said, that the yuan is heading back to weaker levels it hit against the greenback a few weeks ago.Mr Tihanyi says the move to set the yuan weaker isn't a reaction by policy makers to news Saturday that China recorded a rare trade deficit in February, but is an element of a broader effort by the central bank to overhaul the financial system. Beijing is seeking to make it clear to investors that the yuan isn't a one-way bet, laying the groundwork for allowing the currency to trade more freely.Premier Li Keqiang said last week at the National People's Congress, China's annual legislative session, that Beijing would expand the currency-trading band.The trade figures, as well as disappointing news about inflation released over the weekend, weren't surprising and reflect seasonal factors, analysts and strategists said. Exports plummeted, leaving the world's second-largest economy with a $US22.9 billion ($A25.2bn) monthly trade deficit, its first since early last year. Imports, however, were up 10.1 per cent from a year earlier, pointing to undamaged Chinese demand."We aren't surprised by the trade deficit in February, as China used to record a deficit in February or March in recent years and we don't think there is a big chance China will post a deficit again in March," said Huang Yi, head of currencies and commodities of China Guangfa Bank.Mr Huang said that while the deficit has changed some investors' and institutions' short-term expectations, the selloff in the yuan wasn't overwhelming. The "two-way" movement will persist in the short run, he said.Analysts note that volatility in the currency has risen dramatically over the past few weeks from record lows, after the yuan spooked market participants with an unexpected 1.3 per cent tumble in late February and early March. The yuan usually barely budges; it gained 2.9 per cent in all of 2013.On Monday, the yuan touched 6.1458 against the dollar, compared with 6.1260 late Friday in New York. The offshore yuan, which is freely traded outside China, fell as low as 6.1309 from 6.1095 on Friday.Some say while the weekend's economic news was a factor behind the decision to change the reference rate, Chinese policy makers have taken the news as an opportunity to prompt caution in the market and shake out speculators who have driven money into China."We expect that the trade figures will be more real in the coming months as the [yuan] has become much more volatile and less predictable than before," economists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. wrote in a note on March 8. The gap, or spread, between interest rates in the onshore and offshore markets is narrowing, potentially deterring people from pumping money into mainland China to take advantage of high yields in the onshore market, they said.

Dozens of protesters, some dressed in Red Guard uniforms, marched through Mong Kok yesterday urging mainland visitors to "love their country and party" - and stay at home.They waved copies of Mao's "little red book" and chanted slogans like, "Love your motherland, use products that are made in China" as they gathered at the sitting-out area in Dundas Street.Some also waved Chinese and Communist Party flags. They said the aim of the march was to reignite patriotic feelings in mainlanders."If they really love their country, they should stay and shop on the mainland, not come to Hong Kong," said Leung Song, 24, convenor of the march's organiser, the Coalition of True Love for Country and Party.Leung said they bought the costumes and props from Taobao, a mainland e-commerce platform. "We support Chinese products and our motherland," he said.Another protester, Alex Lam, 21, a university student, said: "We do not dislike mainland tourists. We simply want to support them in their development of patriotic love, and think it'd be better for them to buy Chinese instead of foreign imported products."The group organised the protest on Facebook where an event page, "True love for country and party march", was created. About 350 people clicked that they would attend.Police upset the protesters by splitting them into small groups for the march. They then separated themselves into their own groups and marched along Sai Yeung Choi Street South, ignoring police orders.Some of them marched to Nathan Road after reaching Argyle Street. They shouted abuse at mainland customers inside shops, forcing some Nathan Road jewellery stores to close briefly.Li Qing, a 27-year-old from Guangdong shopping in the area, said: "Hong Kong is a free city where people can do whatever they want.

After two years, Central China Securities has scrapped its plans for an initial public offering in Shanghai as the mainland brokerage believes it will be easier and quicker to raise up to US$400 million in Hong Kong.The mid-sized firm, based in Henan province, appeared on the global radar in 2008 when it announced with Wall Street bank Citigroup a plan to set up an investment banking joint venture.The plan was later scrapped as Citigroup decided to team up with other local partners.Central China Securities had hired CCB International, the Hong Kong-based investment banking arm of China Construction Bank, one of the Big Four state-run banks headquartered in Beijing, to be the lead sponsor for its upcoming offer in Hong Kong, people familiar with the situation said.The firm had not yet formally applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for the listing, but it aimed to launch it within two months, the sources said."It will definitely be in the first half of this year," one of them said. "The market environment changes quickly, and the key is to get listed as soon as you can."Central China Securities' plans for a Hong Kong float came as a surprise to some industry executives, but others said it reflected the new thinking at the mainland's securities regulator.During the annual meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the industry watchdog might abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the regulator.This would make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the future.Yao's remark is good news for capital-hungry mainland firms facing a nationwide downturn in economic growth, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a large backlog from the recently lifted 15-month suspension of listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses."Timing means everything in the financial business," said another source. "Central China Securities has sort of wasted two years in preparing its plan for a Shanghai IPO, and as it has been proven to be much easier to list in Hong Kong, then why not?"The trick to getting a company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days: first, secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half the shares in the flotation.That is why some bankers joke that Hong Kong's listing market looks more like a series of private placements these days.Mainland brokerages are no strangers to the Hong Kong stock market. Top-tier players such as Citic Securities and Haitong Securities have listed in the city in the past few years. So have mainland banks, including all the Big Four.


"As long as you can meet the listing requirements of the Hong Kong stock exchange, you should definitely go there."That was the clear message from one of the most senior stock market regulators on the mainland when asked about the funding needs of small-sized, capital-hungry private enterprises.During the once-a-year political summit in Beijing last week, Yao Gang, vice-chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the mainland's stock market watchdog may simply abolish a policy requiring mainland companies planning a listing in Hong Kong to first seek approval from the CSRC. This will make it easier and faster for mainland companies to raise capital on the Hong Kong stock exchange in the foreseeable future.The trick to getting any company listed is secure so-called cornerstone investorsYao's comment is certainly good news for mainland firms fighting the nationwide economic downturn, tightening loan approvals from local banks and a 15-month suspension of domestic listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen where the mainland's two national bourses are based. But is this really good news for Hong Kong?The Hong Kong stock exchange may welcome the move as more IPOs from the north could strengthen the city's position as a global capital-raising centre - it was the world's No2 destination for IPOs in terms of total amount raised last year. The New York stock exchange was in first place.Investment bankers will also welcome the move for sure. The more IPOs, the more fees they get, and that also means bigger bonuses. However, let's consider the quality of the IPOs rather than the quantity.Last week in Beijing Yao encouraged the nation's small and medium-sized private enterprises to first consider Hong Kong, not Shanghai or Shenzhen, for listing partly because of the widely accepted assumption in the financial industry that small firms have an easier time raising money here than on the mainland.He also indicated that large state-owned enterprises, although they have the freedom to come to Hong Kong for IPOs, should still consider domestic listings as their first choice. Fund managers say Yao's comments are in line with Beijing's long-term stance that quality blue-chip companies should list domestically so mainland investors can first share in their business success, and perhaps enjoy fat dividends as well.Then what about Hong Kong? By welcoming these smaller firms from the north, which may find it hard to raise money at home, are we turning the Hong Kong stock market into a rubbish bin, or are we just Plan B for those who cannot list at home.The trick to getting any company listed in Hong Kong is simple these days; just secure so-called cornerstone investors to subscribe to about half your IPO shares.

Dozens of protesters, some dressed in Red Guard uniforms, marched through Mong Kok yesterday urging mainland visitors to "love their country and party" - and stay at home.They waved copies of Mao's "little red book" and chanted slogans like, "Love your motherland, use products that are made in China" as they gathered at the sitting-out area in Dundas Street.Some also waved Chinese and Communist Party flags. They said the aim of the march was to reignite patriotic feelings in mainlanders."If they really love their country, they should stay and shop on the mainland, not come to Hong Kong," said Leung Song, 24, convenor of the march's organiser, the Coalition of True Love for Country and Party.Leung said they bought the costumes and props from Taobao, a mainland e-commerce platform. "We support Chinese products and our motherland," he said.Another protester, Alex Lam, 21, a university student, said: "We do not dislike mainland tourists. We simply want to support them in their development of patriotic love, and think it'd be better for them to buy Chinese instead of foreign imported products."The group organised the protest on Facebook where an event page, "True love for country and party march", was created. About 350 people clicked that they would attend.Police upset the protesters by splitting them into small groups for the march. They then separated themselves into their own groups and marched along Sai Yeung Choi Street South, ignoring police orders.Some of them marched to Nathan Road after reaching Argyle Street. They shouted abuse at mainland customers inside shops, forcing some Nathan Road jewellery stores to close briefly.Li Qing, a 27-year-old from Guangdong shopping in the area, said: "Hong Kong is a free city where people can do whatever they want. I understand why they do this, as they think there are too many visitors."A protest against mainland visitors in Tsim Sha Tsui last month, accusing them of overwhelming the city and hogging its resources, drew condemnation from Beijing and senior officials in Hong Kong, including Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying.

Insurers from Hong Kong and other overseas markets are lobbying mainland authorities for permission to sell products in Guangdong province after finding it hard to compete with domestic players, according to industry players.Chan Kin-por, legislator for the insurance sector, told the South China Morning Post that he and some officials from the Office of Commissioner of Insurance recently urged mainland authorities in Qianhai and Guangdong to allow Hong Kong-based insurers to use their Hong Kong agents to sell products to residents there. They also pressed for more flexible product approvals."Over more than 20 years of development, foreign insurers still find it hard to compete in the mainland insurance market where combined they have less than 4 per cent of the market," Chan said, adding that part of the reason was that domestic rivals had more sales agents.He said foreign insurers found it hard to bring their best-selling products to mainland customers."Unlike Hong Kong where insurers can freely introduce any new insurance products, in China all insurance companies must first get regulatory approval before any new product launch. The regulator does not approve overseas insurers bringing in innovative insurance products to the mainland and that prevents them competing with new products," Chan said.Manuel Bauer, a board member of German insurer Allianz, one of the first batch of foreign insurers in 1999, said it would be tough to compete with mainland insurers."The domestic mainland insurance companies are so dominant that it is a mission impossible for the foreign insurance [company]," Bauer told the South China Morning Post during a visit to Hong Kong last week.Total gross premiums for foreign insurance companies last year stood at 67.99 billion yuan (HK$86.04 billion), representing only 3.9 per cent of the market, with the rest taken by domestic insurers, according to data from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.Bauer said Allianz would continue to expand on the mainland where it sells a wide range of policies including life, pension, motor insurance and asset management products. The firm's total gross premiums in China rose 30 per cent last year.Despite the low market share, foreign insurers experienced strong growth in mainland sales and future prospects were bright, he said. All foreign life insurance firms in China posted 25.56 per cent growth in premium income last year while all foreign general insurers saw a 23.63 per cent gain in premiums, government statistics showed."China has a huge population. The country is still in its early stage of development in the insurance market," said Bauer. "Its insurance penetration rate is lower than in other international markets. This provides a lot of room for growth."Swiss Re said premiums in mainland China in 2012 represented only 2.96 per cent of its gross domestic product, against 8.18 per cent in the United States, 11.27 per cent in Britain, 12.44 per cent in Hong Kong and 18.19 per cent in Taiwan.

China significantly weakens yuanChina's central bank weakened the daily reference rate for its currency by the largest percentage in more than a year and a half, continuing a push to drive the yuan lower.As sluggish economic news sent jitters through the market, the People's Bank of China set the daily reference rate Monday at 6.1312 to the US dollar, compared with 6.1201 to the US dollar on Friday. The 0.18 per cent change represented the largest one-day move in the rate since July 2012.The central bank determines the rate each day, and then allows the currency to trade as much as 1 per cent higher or lower. Since 2005, it has gradually moved the rate up, allowing the yuan to strengthen 33 per cent, but in the last month has pushed it lower, seeking to discourage speculators who have channeled money into the economy in hopes of benefiting from the currency's rise.The US dollar-Chinese yuan pair was fixed "much higher than what the market environment would have otherwise suggested," said Sacha Tihanyi, a senior currency strategist at Scotiabank in Hong Kong. This suggests, he said, that the yuan is heading back to weaker levels it hit against the greenback a few weeks ago.Mr Tihanyi says the move to set the yuan weaker isn't a reaction by policy makers to news Saturday that China recorded a rare trade deficit in February, but is an element of a broader effort by the central bank to overhaul the financial system. Beijing is seeking to make it clear to investors that the yuan isn't a one-way bet, laying the groundwork for allowing the currency to trade more freely.Premier Li Keqiang said last week at the National People's Congress, China's annual legislative session, that Beijing would expand the currency-trading band.The trade figures, as well as disappointing news about inflation released over the weekend, weren't surprising and reflect seasonal factors, analysts and strategists said. Exports plummeted, leaving the world's second-largest economy with a $US22.9 billion ($A25.2bn) monthly trade deficit, its first since early last year. Imports, however, were up 10.1 per cent from a year earlier, pointing to undamaged Chinese demand."We aren't surprised by the trade deficit in February, as China used to record a deficit in February or March in recent years and we don't think there is a big chance China will post a deficit again in March," said Huang Yi, head of currencies and commodities of China Guangfa Bank.Mr Huang said that while the deficit has changed some investors' and institutions' short-term expectations, the selloff in the yuan wasn't overwhelming. The "two-way" movement will persist in the short run, he said.Analysts note that volatility in the currency has risen dramatically over the past few weeks from record lows, after the yuan spooked market participants with an unexpected 1.3 per cent tumble in late February and early March. The yuan usually barely budges; it gained 2.9 per cent in all of 2013.On Monday, the yuan touched 6.1458 against the dollar, compared with 6.1260 late Friday in New York. The offshore yuan, which is freely traded outside China, fell as low as 6.1309 from 6.1095 on Friday.Some say while the weekend's economic news was a factor behind the decision to change the reference rate, Chinese policy makers have taken the news as an opportunity to prompt caution in the market and shake out speculators who have driven money into China."We expect that the trade figures will be more real in the coming months as the [yuan] has become much more volatile and less predictable than before," economists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. wrote in a note on March 8. The gap, or spread, between interest rates in the onshore and offshore markets is narrowing, potentially deterring people from pumping money into mainland China to take advantage of high yields in the onshore market, they said.
SYDNEY: Shanghai copper dropped by its 5 percent daily limit on Monday to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country's first domestic bond default last week.China's exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.This inflamed worries about appetite, as demand from Chinese consumers has yet to regain steam after the new year break. London copper prices slid to within a whisker of nearly three-year lows, after shedding nearly 4 percent on Friday."Fundamental demand has not resumed to normal levels yet," said analyst Chunlan Li of minerals consultancy CRU in Beijing."We are still waiting to see demand resume, maybe after mid-March -- there's still a chance it will happen."The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent to 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne, its lowest since Sept. 2009.Across the board, heavy selling in Shanghai metals contracts spilled into the new week, with ShFE aluminium hitting a 5-year low, ShFE lead a contract low and ShFE zinc sliding to its weakest in more than four months.Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange had dropped 1.1 percent to $6,709.25 a tonne by 0256 GMT.It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010.But other LME contracts, many with stronger fundamentals than copper this year, held their ground, slipping to multi-week rather than multi-month or year lows.Reflecting ample supply, copper premiums in Shanghai bond have fallen by $20 to $140-$160 from late January, according to China price provider Shmet.China is the world's top user of copper, accounting for 45 percent of global demand. But much of its imports are used for financing, where shipments are sold on domestic markets to raise funds for investment in higher yielding assets like real estate.Worries these deals could unravel flustered traders on Friday after China recorded its first domestic bond default when loss-making solar equipment producer Chaori Solar missed an interest payment, setting a landmark for market discipline in the world's second-largest economy.The default is widely expected to force a re-pricing of credit risk that could pile pressure on weak borrowers.Industries such as metals and mining, shipbuilding and materials are seen as key sectors with high default risks.Li said that there was a substantial risk that sliding property market values or spreading debt market contagion could force copper financing deals to unravel."But I think it's not this year. The government is still expecting a stable slowdown, not a sharp slowdown - clearly real estate is heavily relevant to economic growth."Elsewhere, US job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.Hedge funds and money managers turned copper markets into a net short in the week to March 4, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday.Also curtailing risk appetite, were worries about escalating tensions in Ukraine. Germany's Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine's constitution.

George Zimmerman is still concerned with his safety since his internationally publicized acquittal on second-degree murder charges after the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, he told WOFL-TV/FOX 35 on Saturday.FOX 35 News OrlandoZimmerman spoke to the news station during a controversial appearance at an Orlando gun shop. In the interview, Zimmerman said he is armed and usually wears a bullet proof vest as protection. He said he doesn't understand why people are still angry at him for the deadly shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon."No I don't (understand why people still get angry), but I'm willing to talk to everyone and try and answer their concerns or questions, and help them realize there's no need to be angry," he said.Zimmerman has appeared in the news several times since his acquittal. In the interview, he discussed his since-canceled celebrity boxing match, his paintings including one of the America flag that sold for $100,000 online and another of State Attorney Angela Corey, and his appreciation for his supporters.He did not talk about his recent traffic stops, or his domestic violence cases.dstennett@tribune.com or 407-420-5447

April 6 is so close now I can almost taste it. Like a dragon almost tastes a goat. Sorry, that was weird. Let's just focus on April 6 which is when season four of HBO's Game of Thrones begins. Now that True Detective is over (unexpected ending, right?) it's good to have something to look forward to.This trailer is titled "Secrets" and it appears the secrets are that everyone is even angrier than last time we saw them and that Jon Snow has maintained his hotness level.
Just call us Jon Snow, because we know nothing.The third trailer for Game of Thrones' fourth season dropped Sunday, and, sadly, we're still in the dark about what's in store.This preview does give us more time with Daenerys Targaryen and her very-grown-up dragons as she battles "injustice." We also get a glimpse of a conversation between Cersei Lannister and Oberyn Martell."What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?" Cersei questions.Lena Headey, who plays Cersei, did reveal to Vulture that the reunion between her and her brother/lover Jaime Lannister will be a particularly gripping moment this season.

It's kind of crazy. Interesting to film, because we were ... she's in deep pain, and he wants her, because he missed her, and he needs to know she wants him. It's just a weird, fucked-up moment.

click to enlarge YouTubeGame of Thrones needs more fans?!? LOLS!!As you hear the words dragons, thrones and magic, you're likely to picture burly, bearded cosplayers, caped nerds crammed around a Dungeon and Dragons circle, and leather adorned metalheads. What you wouldn't expect to find in that mix are mainstream hip-hop artists Big Boi and Common -- but here they are ladies and gents. And trust me, it feels just as awkward to write that phrase as it does to digest it, I'm sure.Today, Catch the Throne: The Mixtape, the Game of Thrones inspired soundtrack, drops with 10 tracks of urban angst. The HBO series Game of Thrones season 4 premieres April 6, and with this new collaboration, they hope to generate a dialogue that intrigues new viewers. Lucinda Martinez, SVP of Multicultural Marketing at HBO says in a press release, "We are excited to create an additional fan touch point with Catch The Throne: The Mixtape. This is a unique opportunity to give fans great original music and an innovative way to highlight the electrifying 'Game of Thrones' series."So in short, HBO attempts to expand their audience demographic by showing that rappers and urban folk watch Game of Thrones too? That seems a little silly.How ever you feel about that is up to you, but at least the music is pretty cool, and it definitely has people talking. The songs feature sampled clips and looped mixes of Game of Thrones themes that offer an epic foundation for the artists to tongue-twist catchy rhymes and hooks. The results of the marriage are relentless vocals provided by artists Big Boi, Common, Magazeen and Wale, among others, that drive the folkloric melodies through industrial beats.The lyrics of tracks like "Mother of Dragons" seem to evoke a passion and alliance to Khaleesi with lyrics "Like the rehab on my knee/It won't be that much longer/Before Khaleesi take the Iron Throne/They call it the Mother of Dragons/ You under attack, n---a/It's our home," and "Fuck the Lannisters and everyone ridin' with 'em." So you know these guys are watching the show and apparently some -- like Big Boi -- are huge fans.Check out the full 10-track mixtape below:

The songs feature sampled clips and looped mixes of Game of Thrones themes that offer an epic foundation for the artists to tongue-twist catchy rhymes and hooks. The results of the marriage are relentless vocals provided by artists Big Boi, Common, Magazeen and Wale, among others, that drive the folkloric melodies through industrial beats.The lyrics of tracks like "Mother of Dragons" seem to evoke a passion and alliance to Khaleesi with lyrics "Like the rehab on my knee/It won't be that much longer/Before Khaleesi take the Iron Throne/They call it the Mother of Dragons/ You under attack, n---a/It's our home," and "Fuck the Lannisters and everyone ridin' with 'em."

click to enlarge YouTubeGame of Thrones needs more fans?!? LOLS!!As you hear the words dragons, thrones and magic, you're likely to picture burly, bearded cosplayers, caped nerds crammed around a Dungeon and Dragons circle, and leather adorned metalheads. What you wouldn't expect to find in that mix are mainstream hip-hop artists Big Boi and Common -- but here they are ladies and gents. And trust me, it feels just as awkward to write that phrase as it does to digest it, I'm sure.Today, Catch the Throne: The Mixtape, the Game of Thrones inspired soundtrack, drops with 10 tracks of urban angst. The HBO series Game of Thrones season 4 premieres April 6, and with this new collaboration, they hope to generate a dialogue that intrigues new viewers. Lucinda Martinez, SVP of Multicultural Marketing at HBO says in a press release, "We are excited to create an additional fan touch point with Catch The Throne: The Mixtape. This is a unique opportunity to give fans great original music and an innovative way to highlight the electrifying 'Game of Thrones' series."So in short, HBO attempts to expand their audience demographic by showing that rappers and urban folk watch Game of Thrones too? That seems a little silly.How ever you feel about that is up to you, but at least the music is pretty cool, and it definitely has people talking. The songs feature sampled clips and looped mixes of Game of Thrones themes that offer an epic foundation for the artists to tongue-twist catchy rhymes and hooks. The results of the marriage are relentless vocals provided by artists Big Boi, Common, Magazeen and Wale, among others, that drive the folkloric melodies through industrial beats.The lyrics of tracks like "Mother of Dragons" seem to evoke a passion and alliance to Khaleesi with lyrics "Like the rehab on my knee/It won't be that much longer/Before Khaleesi take the Iron Throne/They call it the Mother of Dragons/ You under attack, n---a/It's our home," and "Fuck the Lannisters and everyone ridin' with 'em."

If this nail-biting new trailer is any indication, the upcoming fourth season of Game of Thrones is going to be even more epic than usual. While it's skimpy on plot details, the minute-and-a-half-long teaser does feature loads of swords, terrifyingly huge dragons, eerie one-liners and dazzling CGI Targaryen armies.20 Best TV Moments of 2013: The Red WeddingOne of the most intriguing snippets features a conversation between Cersei (Lena Headey) and Thrones newcomer Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal): "What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?," Cersei asks, with the latter responding, "We can avenge them." Fans can also catch brief glimpses of Sansa (Sophie Turner) mourning over her family and Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) offering a dramatic warning: "We mustn't disappoint father."The season's first episode, "Two Swords," will premiere Sunday, April 6th at 9 p.m. EST on HBO. For a more thorough preview of the fourth new season, explore this expansive 15-minute trailer, which features the cast and crew hinting at the bloody battles and power plays on the horizon."There is tremendous clamor for revenge, especially in the wake of the Red Wedding," says showrunner David Benioff in the video, while promising fans "bloody confrontations" and "some of the most shocking and mind-blowing scenes in the entire series."Eager fans who can't wait for the April 6th premiere of the fourth season will be able to see the first episode earlier and in much bigger form, as HBO announced that 7,000 people will be able to watch the season premiere at New York's Barclays Center on March 20th. The network will host "The Epic Fan Experience" on a stadium-sized screen that will also include, "show costumes and props displays from the acclaimed traveling exhibition, photo ops on the Iron Throne and other special surprises."

If you're like us, today is a dark day. For the first time in two months, we awake to a world with no True Detective, and what a world it is. The sky just isn't as blue. Our Kale smoothie isn't nearly as refreshing, and Sunday nights will never be the same. Until April 6, that is. That's because when HBO taketh away, they make sure to giveth right back. In just under a month, season 4 of Game of Thrones premieres and, once again, all will be right in the world.

click to enlarge YouTubeGame of Thrones needs more fans?!? LOLS!!As you hear the words dragons, thrones and magic, you're likely to picture burly, bearded cosplayers, caped nerds crammed around a Dungeon and Dragons circle, and leather adorned metalheads. What you wouldn't expect to find in that mix are mainstream hip-hop artists Big Boi and Common -- but here they are ladies and gents. And trust me, it feels just as awkward to write that phrase as it does to digest it, I'm sure.Today, Catch the Throne: The Mixtape, the Game of Thrones inspired soundtrack, drops with 10 tracks of urban angst. The HBO series Game of Thrones season 4 premieres April 6, and with this new collaboration, they hope to generate a dialogue that intrigues new viewers. Lucinda Martinez, SVP of Multicultural Marketing at HBO says in a press release, "We are excited to create an additional fan touch point with Catch The Throne: The Mixtape. This is a unique opportunity to give fans great original music and an innovative way to highlight the electrifying 'Game of Thrones' series."So in short, HBO attempts to expand their audience demographic by showing that rappers and urban folk watch Game of Thrones too? That seems a little silly.How ever you feel about that is up to you, but at least the music is pretty cool, and it definitely has people talking. The songs feature sampled clips and looped mixes of Game of Thrones themes that offer an epic foundation for the artists to tongue-twist catchy rhymes and hooks. The results of the marriage are relentless vocals provided by artists Big Boi, Common, Magazeen and Wale, among others, that drive the folkloric melodies through industrial beats.The lyrics of tracks like "Mother of Dragons" seem to evoke a passion and alliance to Khaleesi with lyrics "Like the rehab on my knee/It won't be that much longer/Before Khaleesi take the Iron Throne/They call it the Mother of Dragons/ You under attack, n---a/It's our home," and "Fuck the Lannisters and everyone ridin' with 'em." So you know these guys are watching the show and apparently some -- like Big Boi -- are huge fans.Check out the full 10-track mixtape below:

Los Angeles - Lindsay Lohan has Oprah Winfrey on speed dial.The recovering actress has been mentored by the talk show star since she completed a 90-day court ordered stint in rehab last year, and says she feels blessed to have such a strong bond with her.She told Extra TV: "I love that I can call Oprah on the phone, and be like, 'Oprah, can we talk right now?' and she calls me within two minutes. I have to trick her into leaving voicemails, so I can just have Oprah's voicemails ... she's the coolest person ever."Lindsay, 27, has also filmed a docu-series for Oprah's OWN network which she is keen to stress isn't a reality show, and she says she had no control over what made the final cut.She added: "I did it because it's not a reality show, it's pretty raw. Obviously it's TV, so things will be edited in certain ways to get ratings, which I can't control, but I do know that my intentions going into it were really pure and really honest. I appreciate all that's happened and all that Oprah has done for me."

11:02: In sum, we need more Oprah. We know there's more Lindsay complaining, Lindsay angst and Lindsay anger. OWN's voice of reason needs to make another appearance, badly.11:00: To come this season on "Lindsay": more problems with shoots. An appearance from her dad, Michael Lohan, and problems with her assistant, Michael. Lindsay on a pole. Lindsay at a doctor's office or hospital(?). Oprah getting angry."The vultures are waiting to pick your bones if you're not ready," Winfrey tells Lindsay. Ruh roh.10:58: Lindsay is stressed again. She can't get the keys to her new apartment. They want a $10 million dollar insurance policy added to the lease. "How the hell could anyone have that?" she tells her broker. "I'm not Oprah." She's now been living in a hotel for 36 days. She requests a new room. She hates living in a hotel. It brings her back to a "crazy" time in her life, when she was also living in a hotel. She doesn't approve of much lately, except for her sister's walk in a fashion show.10:48: Lindsay's shooting a short film to promote ... lingerie! And she doesn't like the script. It's not what she expected. It's all very confusing. The models are waiting. She pulls out of the shoot. "It just wasn't the right timing," she says. Compromising her sobriety, apparently.10:38: Michael, Lindsay's "sober coach" thinks it's a bad idea for her to travel, even when business calls. She also isn't too keen on the idea. So she misses at trip to the Venice Film Festival for the premiere of her movie "Canyons." She's not settled in a routine yet. They're stuck in a room all day because there's paparazzi outside. She's missing meetings because the photographers would follow her. She feels like a prisoner "all the time." Yet she thinks back to the time when a judge wouldn't let her out of actual jail (to make an example of her, Lohan supposes), and she was placed in solitary confinement. The hotel room is probably better.10:33: Lindsay explains the problems with finding an apartment when you're Lindsay Lohan. No one wants Lindsay Lohan in their building, and if they do, they bump up the price, she says. :( :(10:29: Back at Mama Lohan's house in New York, Lindsay sorts through her belongings. She's moving back in until she finds something more permanent. Mama Lohan looks a bit addled. Lindsay hugs her brother, Cody. They "have a special bond," she says."We have so much love in each one of us," Lindsay continues. "It really will be nice when that day comes when there's no more talking and there's only positive things being said, and that will come."10:25: Matt, Lindsay's personal assistant, sounds like he could have a show of his own, having assisted Shaun White, Steven Tyler, Sean Astin ... nevermind, Lindsay would probably deliver enough material.10:18: August 2013. Being back in New York is good for Lindsay, we learn. She's going shopping, trying on hats. Laughing, lighting up a cigarette.10:11: So far Oprah has given Lohan fair warning: We're both here to get the real you, meaning honest Lindsay, not lying Lindsay. Lohan tells Winfrey she's an addict, specifically an alcohol addict. With the actress just four days out of rehab, Winfrey thinks it's a bad idea for her to go on a trip to Europe for yoga. Lohan thinks better of it and decides to stay in the states. We're reminded that this "docu-series" is being directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice. We get a short history of Lindsay, from bright-eyed star of "The Parent Trap" to beleaguered actress-addict.10 p.m.: "Lindsay."Will this prove better than Lindsay Lohan's performance in the Lifetime movie "Liz & Dick?" And by better, meaning worse, meaning better? Anyhow, this is quite a jarring transition from tonight's premiere of Neil deGrasse-Tyson's "Cosmos." A lot of star-gazing, minus the profundity?Whatever the case, whether car-crash TV or an enlightening character study, here's a running chronicle of the events in "Lindsay," a new reality show on OWN, presented by Oprah Winfrey. A whole hour of Lohan, doing what she does. And Oprah, calling her on nonsense, at least once.

Lindsay Lohan made an appearance on 'The Tonight Show' last week, and ended up with water thrown in her face by host Jimmy Fallon.The two played an on-air game of 'Water Wars', where the person who drew the higher number from a deck of cards got to throw a glass of ice cold water in the other's face.Lindsay LohanBefore the game kicked off, while she was still comfortable and dry, Lindsay joked: "This is war," before confessing, "my heart is beating so fast."The star did manage to get her own back in the end, returning the favour and throwing water in the face of Jimmy Fallon and eventually dousing him with a water cannon.During her appearance on the show, she also teased a future 'Mean Girls' reunion, saying that Tina Fey - who wrote the cult teen film - was talking to producer Lorne Michaels about "some sort of reunion".A sequel to the film, 'Mean Girls 2' was released in 2011, though the majority of the original film's cast didn't star in it.The 27-year-old was appearing on 'The Tonight Show' to promote her new reality series 'Lindsay', which made its US TV debut on Oprah's OWN network last night.Lindsay Lohan

I have to trick her into leaving voicemails, so I can just have Oprah's voicemails ... she's the coolest person ever."Lindsay, 27, has also filmed a docu-series for Oprah's OWN network which she is keen to stress isn't a reality show, and she says she had no control over what made the final cut.She added: "I did it because it's not a reality show, it's pretty raw. Obviously it's TV, so things will be edited in certain ways to get ratings, which I can't control, but I do know that my intentions going into it were really pure and really honest. I appreciate all that's happened and all that Oprah has done for me."

Los Angeles - Lindsay Lohan has Oprah Winfrey on speed dial.The recovering actress has been mentored by the talk show star since she completed a 90-day court ordered stint in rehab last year, and says she feels blessed to have such a strong bond with her.She told Extra TV: "I love that I can call Oprah on the phone, and be like, 'Oprah, can we talk right now?' and she calls me within two minutes. I have to trick her into leaving voicemails, so I can just have Oprah's voicemails ... she's the coolest person ever."Lindsay, 27, has also filmed a docu-series for Oprah's OWN network which she is keen to stress isn't a reality show, and she says she had no control over what made the final cut.She added: "I did it because it's not a reality show, it's pretty raw. Obviously it's TV, so things will be edited in certain ways to get ratings, which I can't control, but I do know that my intentions going into it were really pure and really honest. I appreciate all that's happened and all that Oprah has done for me."

11:02: In sum, we need more Oprah. We know there's more Lindsay complaining, Lindsay angst and Lindsay anger. OWN's voice of reason needs to make another appearance, badly.11:00: To come this season on "Lindsay": more problems with shoots. An appearance from her dad, Michael Lohan, and problems with her assistant, Michael. Lindsay on a pole. Lindsay at a doctor's office or hospital(?). Oprah getting angry."The vultures are waiting to pick your bones if you're not ready," Winfrey tells Lindsay. Ruh roh.10:58: Lindsay is stressed again. She can't get the keys to her new apartment. They want a $10 million dollar insurance policy added to the lease. "How the hell could anyone have that?" she tells her broker. "I'm not Oprah." She's now been living in a hotel for 36 days. She requests a new room. She hates living in a hotel. It brings her back to a "crazy" time in her life, when she was also living in a hotel. She doesn't approve of much lately, except for her sister's walk in a fashion show.10:48: Lindsay's shooting a short film to promote ... lingerie! And she doesn't like the script. It's not what she expected. It's all very confusing. The models are waiting. She pulls out of the shoot. "It just wasn't the right timing," she says. Compromising her sobriety, apparently.10:38: Michael, Lindsay's "sober coach" thinks it's a bad idea for her to travel, even when business calls. She also isn't too keen on the idea. So she misses at trip to the Venice Film Festival for the premiere of her movie "Canyons." She's not settled in a routine yet. They're stuck in a room all day because there's paparazzi outside. She's missing meetings because the photographers would follow her. She feels like a prisoner "all the time." Yet she thinks back to the time when a judge wouldn't let her out of actual jail (to make an example of her, Lohan supposes), and she was placed in solitary confinement. The hotel room is probably better.10:33: Lindsay explains the problems with finding an apartment when you're Lindsay Lohan. No one wants Lindsay Lohan in their building, and if they do, they bump up the price, she says. :( :(10:29: Back at Mama Lohan's house in New York, Lindsay sorts through her belongings. She's moving back in until she finds something more permanent. Mama Lohan looks a bit addled. Lindsay hugs her brother, Cody. They "have a special bond," she says."We have so much love in each one of us," Lindsay continues. "It really will be nice when that day comes when there's no more talking and there's only positive things being said, and that will come."10:25: Matt, Lindsay's personal assistant, sounds like he could have a show of his own, having assisted Shaun White, Steven Tyler, Sean Astin ... nevermind, Lindsay would probably deliver enough material.10:18: August 2013. Being back in New York is good for Lindsay, we learn. She's going shopping, trying on hats. Laughing, lighting up a cigarette.10:11: So far Oprah has given Lohan fair warning: We're both here to get the real you, meaning honest Lindsay, not lying Lindsay. Lohan tells Winfrey she's an addict, specifically an alcohol addict. With the actress just four days out of rehab, Winfrey thinks it's a bad idea for her to go on a trip to Europe for yoga. Lohan thinks better of it and decides to stay in the states. We're reminded that this "docu-series" is being directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice. We get a short history of Lindsay, from bright-eyed star of "The Parent Trap" to beleaguered actress-addict.10 p.m.: "Lindsay."Will this prove better than Lindsay Lohan's performance in the Lifetime movie "Liz & Dick?" And by better, meaning worse, meaning better? Anyhow, this is quite a jarring transition from tonight's premiere of Neil deGrasse-Tyson's "Cosmos." A lot of star-gazing, minus the profundity?Whatever the case, whether car-crash TV or an enlightening character study, here's a running chronicle of the events in "Lindsay," a new reality show on OWN, presented by Oprah Winfrey. A whole hour of Lohan, doing what she does. And Oprah, calling her on nonsense, at least once.

So she misses at trip to the Venice Film Festival for the premiere of her movie "Canyons." She's not settled in a routine yet. They're stuck in a room all day because there's paparazzi outside. She's missing meetings because the photographers would follow her. She feels like a prisoner "all the time." Yet she thinks back to the time when a judge wouldn't let her out of actual jail (to make an example of her, Lohan supposes), and she was placed in solitary confinement. The hotel room is probably better.10:33: Lindsay explains the problems with finding an apartment when you're Lindsay Lohan. No one wants Lindsay Lohan in their building, and if they do, they bump up the price, she says. :( :(10:29: Back at Mama Lohan's house in New York, Lindsay sorts through her belongings. She's moving back in until she finds something more permanent. Mama Lohan looks a bit addled. Lindsay hugs her brother, Cody. They "have a special bond," she says."We have so much love in each one of us," Lindsay continues. "It really will be nice when that day comes when there's no more talking and there's only positive things being said, and that will come."10:25: Matt, Lindsay's personal assistant, sounds like he could have a show of his own, having assisted Shaun White, Steven Tyler, Sean Astin ... nevermind, Lindsay would probably deliver enough material.10:18: August 2013. Being back in New York is good for Lindsay, we learn. She's going shopping, trying on hats. Laughing, lighting up a cigarette.10:11: So far Oprah has given Lohan fair warning: We're both here to get the real you, meaning honest Lindsay, not lying Lindsay. Lohan tells Winfrey she's an addict, specifically an alcohol addict. With the actress just four days out of rehab, Winfrey thinks it's a bad idea for her to go on a trip to Europe for yoga. Lohan thinks better of it and decides to stay in the states. We're reminded that this "docu-series" is being directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice. We get a short history of Lindsay, from bright-eyed star of "The Parent Trap" to beleaguered actress-addict.10 p.m.: "Lindsay."Will this prove better than Lindsay Lohan's performance in the Lifetime movie "Liz & Dick?" And by better, meaning worse, meaning better? Anyhow, this is quite a jarring transition from tonight's premiere of Neil deGrasse-Tyson's "Cosmos." A lot of star-gazing, minus the profundity?Whatever the case, whether car-crash TV or an enlightening character study, here's a running chronicle of the events in "Lindsay," a new reality show on OWN, presented by Oprah Winfrey. A whole hour of Lohan, doing what she does. And Oprah, calling her on nonsense, at least once.

Lindsay finds "Fetch" T-shirts from Mean GirlsWhile sifting through her discarded boxes at her mom Dina's house, Lohan happens upon a pile of "Fetch" T-shirts made for the popular catch phrase from the 2004 film Mean Girls.3.

He also declined a multiple opportunities to tell Nikki that he loved her during the reunion show.Ferrell said that Juan Pablo's actions speak louder than words."If he wasn't invested in the relationship, he wouldn't be with me," she said.During their home visit to Kansas City, Galavis and Ferrell visited Oklahoma Joe's BBQ and a bar at Kansas City's Power and Light District.Ferrell and Galavis didn't reveal what their next plans were or whether they planned to continue to live in separate cities.

UPI News Service, 03/10/2014One-time Bachelorette winner Jef Holm described Juan Pablo Galavis as the "sleaziest" Bachelor last month, after Andi Dorfman became the second contestant this season to dump Galavis and leave the show.ADVERTISEMENTWith Galavis set to choose between Nikki and Clare on Monday night's finale, sources close to the series have begun to air their real feelings about the 32-year-old former soccer player."He's the worst bachelor ever," one show insider told E! News, while another said, "Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over.""His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding, which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend," the source said of the previous season's couple, who married in January.The behind-the-scenes trash-talking comes shortly after Galavis defended a online joke about people with intellectual disabilities."Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r****d can read, but look at you go, little buddy!" read the fan message retweeted by Galavis. "Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f**king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!"Galavis added "LOVED IT" to the retweet, but deleted the post when users pointed out the insensitive nature of the joke.By way of apology, Galavis said that Americans needed to "enjoy jokes and sarcasm.""People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM..." he said, noting that he doesn't have the best command of the English language. "In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect.""Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture," he added.This isn't the first time Galavis has had to defend his comments. In January, he apologized for saying that gays and lesbians couldn't be on The Bachelor because it didn't "set a good example for kids.""If you listen to the entire interview, there's nothing but respect for gay people and their families. I have many gay friends and one of my closest friends who's like a brother has been a constant in my life especially during the past 5 months," he explained.

Thank God our love affair with Juan Pablo ends tonight. He will go down in infamy as the worst Bachelor/person to ever exist on this earth, and I am so thoroughly excited for Nikki to break up with him and do a tell-all Us Magazine interview revealing his weirdest, most disgusting habits. I'll bet he sucks on his own toes. Anyway, this is the grand finale, through deconstructed quotes."The controversy centering around Juan Pablo has been unlike anything we have ever seen before on The Bachelor."Who said it: Chris HarrisonWhy he said it: What Chris means here is there was controversy surrounding Juan Pablo's comments on homosexuality and the mentally handicapped, on top of the controversy caused by his sad, stupid self."Today i'm gonna keep an eye on Claire to see how she interacts and how she fits into my family."Who said it: Juan Pablo to the camerasWhy he said it: You know when awful guys know a girl is not for them but are too driven by their dick and sleep with them anyway and then start to resent them, when really it's them resenting themselves? This is what Juan Pablo's relationship with Clare is like."I love love love family."Who said it: Clare-bear :(Why she said it: Notice how there is no possessive pronoun before the word "family" here and it is just "family." Clare just loves family the way kids love snacks and sprinklers and when their dads spin them around. :("You got your ears pierced?" *feigns surprise* I love that!"Who said it: Claire talking to Camila :\Why she said it: Because she has no clue how to talk to kids I don't think."He's hyperactive. Super hyperactive."Who said it: JP's mom to ClareWhy she said it: Great question. This is the kind of thing you say about a a fifth grader-- to their new babysitter, not to somebody who might end up marrying your son."What do you feel about your communication about Juan Pablo?" - Juan Pablo's mom"I love it." - ClaireWhy this happened: Wish I could explain this but instead I'll just choke-laugh it out over here."I could 1000% see myself as a part of Juan Pablo's family forever."Who said it: Who do you think :( (Clare)Why she said it: Because homegirl is s0o0o clueless it's beginning to get sad :( Notice how I've been sad facing all over the place :( :("Latinos are passion as hell."Who said it: That guy in Juan Pablo's family. Either his cousin or his brother or his best friend or both.Why he said it: It's true, latinos are "passion as hell." Juan Pablo, however, is not."I could not appreciate everything I am experiencing this much if he wasn't next to me."Who said it: ClareWhy she said it: This is just a depressing quote and I'm gonna move on right now."Maybe he's not the man that he thought he was. I am so confused right now and I really don't know what to do next."Who said it: CLAREWhy she said it: Juan Pablo said something nasty to Clare when there were no cameras-- something along the lines of "I don't even know you that well but I really like f%ing you" I'm going to guess-- and instead of not realizing how sleazy it is Clare STANDS UP FOR HERSELF and realizes that something isn't right."So that's why you didn't give me a kiss? Okay."Who said it: JP, smugly, to Clare when she invites him over the night before the decision and she decides not to kiss him at the doorWhy he said it: Cuz he's a f$*#ing dick."I have much more to offer a relationship than just [physical attraction.]"Who said it: Clare, who is suddenly not a robot!!!Why she said it: A lightbulb went off?"Honestly do I see myself with you? Yeah, I could see myself with you, sure."Who said it: JP to Clare, as unconvincingly as it sounds.Why he said it: See two above^"It was painful to watch. I could hear the collective sigh in here as she was starting to give in."Who said it: Sean, The Bachelor from last season who is at the live show tonight. Sean seems mad cool guys, I'm pissed I didn't watch his season.Why he said it: Cuz he's a real cool dude, apparently"Every day I want something to happen that makes me feel better about that person."Who said it: The indecisive idiot that is Juan PabloWhy he said it: Well, the two girls he was really into dumped him, and now he's left with two girls he's not psyched on. So hopefully some love potion can drop from the sky for him so he can make some sort of decision. Yeesh."It has to be me. He can't have what he has with me with anyone else."Who said it: NikkiWhy she said it: Sometimes I wonder if Nikki just wants to beat Clare, not marry Juan Pablo."Like I know my dad would be proud that I've opened myself up."Who said it: Clare, as she walks toward JP :(Why she said it: Alsakjdal;ksjdal;ksjalkdjs"When you came out of the limo with the belly- I thought look at her..."Who said it: JPWhy he said it: Ohhh right. I had forgotten how Clare was the one who was wearing a fake baby bump on the first episode. *Cringes*"I wish the earth sucked me today because this is the hardest decision ever."Who said it: Juan Pablo the babyWhy he said it: Because he is a hyperactive baby who can't make a decision to save his life"This entire time I stuck around because I believed in you."Who said it: CLAREEEEEEEEWhy she said it: SHE'S TELLING HIM OFF"I'VE SAVED THIS MOMENT FOR THE MAN OF MY DREAMS BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE ONE"Who said it: CLAREEEEEEEE"I'VE LOST RESPECT FOR YOU"Who said it: CLAREEEEEEEE"I WOULD NEVER WANT MY CHILDREN HAVING A FATHER LIKE YOU"Who said it: CLAREEEEEEEE"Don't get cranky now."Who said it: Juan Pablo to Nikki after he gave her the rose but not the engagement ringWhy he said it: No clue. I genuinely have no clue."Why was 'I like you a lot' enough for Nikki?"Who said it: CHRIS HARRISON, and all of us.Why he said it: Because this entire season of The Bachelor was a waste of everyone's time. ALL THANKS TO JUAN PABLO.
